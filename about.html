	<h1>About Astropy</h1>

	<p> The Astropy Project is a community effort to develop a core package for astronomy using the <a href="http://www.python.org">Python programming language</a> and improve usability, interoperability, and collaboration between astronomy Python packages.  The core <i>astropy</i> package contains functionality aimed at professional astronomers and astrophysicists, but may be useful to anyone developing astronomy software.  The Astropy Project also includes "affiliated packages," Python packages that are not necessarily developed by the core development team, but share the goals of Astropy, and often build from the core package's code and infrastructure. </p>
	<p>For more details on the plan for the project, you can read the <a href="http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/overview.html">documentation overview</a>, or the <a href="http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/vision.html">original vision</a> from when the project was founded. </p>

		<h2>Acknowledging or Citing Astropy</h2>

		<h3>In Publications</h3>

		<p>If you use Astropy for work/research presented in a publication (whether directly, or as a dependency to another package), we ask that you cite the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201322068" target="_blank">Astropy Paper</a> (<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A%26A...558A..33A" target="_blank">ADS</a> -
		<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2013A%26A...558A..33A&amp;data_type=BIBTEX&amp;db_key=AST&amp;nocookieset=1" target="_blank">BibTeX</a>).
        We provide the following as a standard  acknowledgment you can use if there is not a specific place to cite the paper:</p>

		<p class="citation"><cite>This research made use of Astropy, a community-developed core Python package for Astronomy (Astropy Collaboration, 2013).</cite></p>

		<p>If you wish, you can also include a link to <cite>http://www.astropy.org</cite> (if the journal allows this) in addition to the above text.</p>

		<h3>In Presentations</h3>

		<p>If you are giving a presentation or talk featuring work/research that makes use of Astropy and would like to acknowledge Astropy, we suggest using this logo on your title slide:</p>

		<img src="http://www.astropy.org/images/astropy_powered.png" alt="Powered by Astropy" />

		<p>The logo is also available <a href="http://www.astropy.org/images/astropy_powered_white.png">with white text</a>, or the SVG originals can be obtained at the <a href="http://github.com/astropy/astropy-logo" target="_blank">astropy-logo github repository.</a></p>

		<h3>In Projects</h3>

		<p>If you are using Astropy as part of a code project (e.g., affiliated packages), a useful way to acknowledge your use of Astropy is with a badge in your README. We suggest this badge: </p>



		<img src="http://img.shields.io/badge/powered%20by-AstroPy-orange.svg?style=flat" alt="Powered by Astropy Badge"/>

		<p> Which is available at the URL <cite>http://img.shields.io/badge/powered%20by-AstroPy-orange.svg?style=flat</cite>. If your code is hosted on github, You can place the following in your README.md file to get the badge:</p>


		<cite>[![astropy](http://img.shields.io/badge/powered%20by-AstroPy-orange.svg?style=flat)](http://www.astropy.org/)</cite>

		<h2>Astropy Community Code of Conduct</h2>

		<p>The community of participants in open source Astronomy projects is made up of members from around the globe with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences success and continued growth. We expect everyone in our community to follow these guidelines when interacting with others both inside and outside of our community. Our goal is to keep ours a positive, inclusive, successful, and growing community.</p>

		<p>As members of the community,</p>

		<ul>
		<li>We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide a harassment- and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual orientation and/or gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. In particular, sexual language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes are not appropriate.</li>
		<li>We pledge to respect the work of others by recognizing acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors. As authors, we pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or acknowledged.</li>
		<li>We pledge to welcome those interested in joining the community, and realize that including people with a variety of opinions and backgrounds will only serve to enrich our community. In particular, discussions relating to pros/cons of various technologies, programming languages, and so on are welcome, but these should be done with respect, taking proactive measure to ensure that all participants are heard and feel confident that they can freely express their opinions.</li>
		<li>We pledge to welcome questions and answer them respectfully, paying particular attention to those new to the community. We pledge to provide respectful criticisms and feedback in forums, especially in discussion threads resulting from code contributions.</li>
		<li>We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of the wider community and to respond to criticism respectfully. We will strive to model behaviors that encourage productive debate and disagreement, both within our community and where we are criticized. We will treat those outside our community with the same respect as people within our community.</li>
		<li>We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct, and to not remain silent when we see violations of the code of conduct. We will take action when members of our community violate this code such as contacting confidential@astropy.org (all emails sent to this address will be treated with the strictest confidence) or talking privately with the person.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>This code of conduct applies to all community situations online and offline, including mailing lists, forums, social media, conferences, meetings, associated social events, and one-to-one interactions.</p>
